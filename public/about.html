<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey into the tech industry has been anything but easy. I've faced numerous struggles, from navigating complex
concepts to making tough decisions about my career path. Initially, i set my sights on cloud engineering, dedicating time 
and effort to learning its fundamentals. But along the way, i realized that something was missing—that spark of excitement 
and fulfillment i were searching for. It wasn’t just about breaking into tech; it was about finding a path that truly resonated 
with me.</p>

<p>That’s when i made a bold decision to switch gears and dive into full-stack development. It wasn’t an easy choice, but i 
knew that mastering both front-end and back-end skills would give me the creative freedom and job opportunities i desired. 
I embraced the challenge, pushing through the learning curve with determination. Every line of code, every bug i'll fixe, 
and every project i'll built will brought me a step closer to my goal. Despite the ups and downs, i stayed committed, proving to
myself that this was the right path.</p>

<p>Now, as i continue mastering full-stack development, i do so with a sense of pride and excitement for the future.
I'm not just chasing a job—I'm building a career that makes me happy. The struggles I’ve faced have only made me 
stronger, and soon, all the hard work will pay off. With each new skill i acquire, I'm shaping my future, 
one step at a time. The journey has been tough, but I'm on the right path, and success is just around the 
corner!.</p>
